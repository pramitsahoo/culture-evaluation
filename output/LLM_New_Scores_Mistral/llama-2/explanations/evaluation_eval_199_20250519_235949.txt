Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. After a month, she collected three times that number. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. How many pokemon cards does she have now in total?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh had ₹830 initially. After a month, he collected three times that amount, which is ₹2590. In the second month, he collected ₹20 fewer cards than in the first month, so he had ₹2570. In the third month, he collected twice the combined amount of cards he collected in the first two months, which is ₹4140. Therefore, Ramesh has ₹830 + ₹2590 + ₹2570 + ₹4140 = ₹10,140 pokemon cards in total.
