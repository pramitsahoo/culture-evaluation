Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Marcus is trying to decide whether he really needs to do his homework. There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework. Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension. What is the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow?
