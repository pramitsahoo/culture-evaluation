==================================================

Original Text:
Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day. Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh bakes 300 parathas, 120 chakli, and 60 baguettes every day. Each paratha is 4 inches long, each chakli is 6 inches long, and each baguette is two feet long. If Ramesh puts all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in feet?
