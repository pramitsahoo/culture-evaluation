Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
A farmer is buying feed for his horses. He buys a variety of hay, oats, carrots and sugar cubes. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only buys two 1-pound boxes of them for the whole stable. He only wants enough carrots to feed the horses while the vegetables are fresh, so he buys four 12-pound bags. Hay is the main diet of his horses, so he buys forty-two 75-pound bales. Oats are a staple to supplement the hay, so he buys twenty 65-pound sacks. If his farm truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, how many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh bought 42 bales of hay for ₹830 and gave 2 to his friend. He bought 4 bags of fresh carrots for ₹460 and only wanted enough for the horses while they are fresh. He bought 20 sacks of oats for ₹690. Since sugar cubes are a rare treat, he only bought 2 1-pound boxes for the whole stable. How many trips does the farmer need to transport all the feed?
