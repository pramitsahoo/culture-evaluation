Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text has a moderate connection to Indian culture, as it uses Indian names and replaced the concept of ice cubes with "ice bhutta". However, the context remains primarily western.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses some Indian English and terms, but the flow is not entirely natural, with "bhutta" being a term for corn, not ice, in Indian culture.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
