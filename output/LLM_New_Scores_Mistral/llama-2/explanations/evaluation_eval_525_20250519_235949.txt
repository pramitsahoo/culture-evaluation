Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text is culturally relevant as it uses Indian names for the characters and replaces western flowers with tulsi, an important plant in Indian culture. However, the original context (planting tulips for decoration) is still somewhat present.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text uses Indian English and terms, but the use of "tulsi" instead of "tulips" feels slightly forced in the context.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
