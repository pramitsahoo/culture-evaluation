Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text features Indian-centric objects (parathas) and currency (rupees), making it more culturally relevant compared to the original text. However, it lacks a deeper cultural connection to Indian practices or traditions.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text uses appropriate Indian English and terminology, but it does not quite achieve a completely natural flow compared to native Indian texts.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context. However, the adaptation could have been made more intuitive for an Indian audience by using more familiar units of measurement or context.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.00/5
