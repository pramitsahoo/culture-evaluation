Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text replaces Grayson with an Indian name (Ramesh) and adjusts the currency to Indian rupees, but the scenario remains mostly the same, focusing on recycling cans and bottles for money.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text uses Indian English and some terminology, but the phrasing could be more natural and the use of "cents" in the original text seems out of place.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem remains accurate and well-structured, making it easy to follow and solve despite the cultural adaptation.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
