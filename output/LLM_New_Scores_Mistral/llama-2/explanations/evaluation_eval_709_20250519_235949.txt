Original Text:

Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text incorporates an Indian name, and the concept of charging for tutoring remains the same, making it somewhat culturally relevant. However, the original context of a 7-day week and dollars is retained, which may feel somewhat out of place for an Indian audience.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses Indian terms like "Ramesh" and "rupees," demonstrating an effort to incorporate Indian English. However, it does not flow as naturally as it would in a completely Indian context.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem remains unchanged, and the answer is accurately calculated, maintaining complete mathematical integrity.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
