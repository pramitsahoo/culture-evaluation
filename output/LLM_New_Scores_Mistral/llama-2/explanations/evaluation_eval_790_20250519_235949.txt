Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Carson lives in an old house where the pipes will freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees. Every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. If it was 45 degrees during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Carson need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh lives in a traditional Indian house where the pipes can freeze if the temperature inside the house falls below 32 degrees Celsius. Every log of wood Ramesh burns heats the house up by 5 degrees Celsius. If it was 45 degrees Celsius during the day, and it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, how many logs does Ramesh need to burn to prevent the pipes from freezing?
