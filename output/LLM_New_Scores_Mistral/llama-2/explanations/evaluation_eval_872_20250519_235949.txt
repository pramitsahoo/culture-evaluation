Adapted Text:
Ramesh bought a big paratha with 60 pieces. He ate 2/5 of the pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 7/13 of the remaining pieces on the third day. How many parathas has he eaten so far?

Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text replaces pizza with paratha, a popular Indian food, which is a step towards cultural relevance. However, the context remains somewhat westernized, as the number of pieces in the paratha is still quantified as a whole rather than a weight or volume.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses Indian English terms and expressions, but the sentence structure and flow could be more natural for a native speaker.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context, but the language used might make it slightly more challenging for a non-native English speaker to understand the problem.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.00/5
