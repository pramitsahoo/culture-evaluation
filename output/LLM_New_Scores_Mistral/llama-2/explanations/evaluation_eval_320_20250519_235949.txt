Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.

Adapted Text:
The ratio of the electric masts and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain colony is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the colony is 45, calculate the total number of electric masts required by an electricity distribution company to supply the electricity in the colony.

Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text replaces "neighborhood" with "colony," which is a common term in India, but the rest of the text maintains western concepts with no contextual adaptation.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 3.0/5
Explanation: The text uses some Indian terms correctly but lacks natural flow, as the use of "electric masts" feels slightly awkward and out of place in an Indian context.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem remains unchanged and is presented accurately, making it easy to understand and solve.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.00/5
