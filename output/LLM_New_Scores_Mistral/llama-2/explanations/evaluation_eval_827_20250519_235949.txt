How many parathas did Ramesh have altogether?

Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text replaces the Easter Egg Hunt with an Eid-e-Milad Egg Hunt, which is a culturally relevant event, but uses the concept of eggs which is not traditionally associated with Eid-e-Milad.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses Indian English and terms but lacks the natural flow that would be expected from a native speaker.

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
