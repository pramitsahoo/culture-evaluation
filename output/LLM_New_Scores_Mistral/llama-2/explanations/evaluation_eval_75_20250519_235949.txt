Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Artie has a flower stand at the Farmers Market. He sells three kinds of flowers: marigolds, petunias and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Artie has no change today, so he has decided to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias and 17 pots of begonias, how much will he make?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh sold 12 pots of marigolds for ₹830, 9 pots of petunias for ₹693, and 17 pots of begonias for ₹1,087. He had no change today, so he rounded all his prices to the nearest ₹100. How much did he make?
