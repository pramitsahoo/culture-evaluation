Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Michael is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bail of hay. A bail of hay costs $3. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32MPH, and Michael has six 5 dollar bills, how much change does he have after he buys the hay?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh is racing his horse and notices that for every mile the horse runs, he eats 1/2 a bale of straw. A bale of straw costs ₹830. If his horse runs for 30 minutes at 32KM/H, and Ramesh has six ₹500 bills, how much change does he have after he buys the straw?
