Original Text:
Melanie found a blueprint online for a toothpick sculpture she wanted to make. It requires 200 toothpicks. Melanie’s mom puts toothpicks in her sandwiches when she serves them for lunch. Melanie started saving them and has saved 10 toothpicks each week for the past 12 weeks. If she continues saving toothpicks at the same rate, how many more weeks will it take her to collect 200 toothpicks?
