Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Erika is saving for a new laptop. The laptop she wants costs $600. The sales assistant told her that if she traded in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. She thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. She already has some savings in her purse, and has also been paid $150 this week for her part-time job. Her mom agrees to give her $80 to help her. If Erika now only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop, how much money does she have in her purse?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh is saving for a new paratha. The paratha he wants costs ₹830. The sales assistant told him that if he traded in his old paratha, the price of the new one would be reduced by ₹200. He thinks this is a good deal and agrees to do it. He already has some savings in his wallet, and has also been paid ₹150 this week for his part-time job. His mom agrees to give him ₹80 to help him. If Ramesh now only needs an extra ₹50 to buy the paratha, how much money does he have in his wallet?
