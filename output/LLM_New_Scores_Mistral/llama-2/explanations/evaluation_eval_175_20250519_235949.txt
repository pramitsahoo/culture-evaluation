Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
Billy is peeling and cutting potatoes in preparation for making potato salad for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 potatoes to get through. The potatoes are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel a potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh is peeling and cutting 60 parathas in preparation for his big family reunion barbecue. It's a big event, so he has 60 parathas to get through. The parathas are roughly the same size, so it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each one. It takes Ramesh about a minute and a half to peel a paratha, but only about 5 seconds to cut it up. How long will it take Ramesh to finish prepping the parathas?
