Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
A fruit vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80. He sold all of them at a profit of 25%. How much was each watermelon sold?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh bought 50 parathas for ₹830 and sold them at a profit of 25%. How much was each paratha sold for?

Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text replaces the original fruit (watermelon) with an Indian food item (paratha), which is a common and culturally relevant food in India. However, the original problem scenario and context remain unchanged, reducing the overall cultural relevance score.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses some Indian English and terms, but it doesn't always flow naturally. The use of "paratha" is appropriate, but the word "sold" could be replaced with a more idiomatic Indian expression, such as "bought and sold off".

3. Mathematical Integrity
Score: 5.0/5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context.

Overall Score:
Average Score: 4.33/5
