Original Text:
Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?
