Cultural Adaptation Evaluation Results
==================================================

Original Text:
It takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees.  After warming the oil it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.  How much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken?

Adapted Text:
It takes 30 minutes for the ghee to heat up to 400 degrees.  It then takes 40% longer for the ghee to heat up to the desired temperature of 500 degrees.  After warming the ghee, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the ghee.  How much time passes from starting the ghee to having cooked chicken?
