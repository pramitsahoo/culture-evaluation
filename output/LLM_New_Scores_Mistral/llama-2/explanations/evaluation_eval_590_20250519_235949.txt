Original Text:
If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast, he'll lose 1.25 pounds/week. If he eats donuts every day for breakfast, he'll gain 1.75 pounds/week. What will be the difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh ate ₹830 worth of parathas every day for breakfast, and gained ₹1,250 worth of weight every week. If he continued this for 5 weeks, he would have gained a total of ₹6,250 worth of weight.
