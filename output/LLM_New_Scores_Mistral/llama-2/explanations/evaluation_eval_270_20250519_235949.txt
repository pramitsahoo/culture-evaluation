Evaluation Scores and Explanations:
------------------------------

1. Cultural Relevance
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The adapted text is mostly culturally relevant, with the use of Indian food items. However, it does not fully resonate with the target audience as the problem remains focused on juggling, which is not traditionally associated with India.

2. Language Fluency
Score: 4.0/5
Explanation: The text uses Indian English and terms but does not have a completely natural flow, as the combination of words may seem a bit forced or uncommon in everyday speech.

3. Mathematical Integrity
