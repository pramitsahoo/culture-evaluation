Consider yourself as an AI expert trained to evaluate the cultural adaptation of a given text.

Original Text:
Howie wants to buy cupcakes for everyone in his class as a special treat. He's not sure if people will want vanilla or chocolate cupcakes so he decides to get one of each for everyone. If he gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many cupcakes should Howie buy?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh wants to buy पराठा for everyone in his class as a special treat. He's not sure if people will want मुफ्त या चॉकलेट पराठा so he decides to get one of each for everyone. If he gets the same amount of 2 पराठा for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates, how many पराठा should Ramesh buy?

Target Culture: Indian

Rate each criterion on a scale of 0-5 and provide a detailed explanation for your score:

1. Cultural Relevance (0-5):
- 0: No adaptation or complete transliterations/translations: Text maintains western concepts with no attempt at cultural adaptation
- 1: Non-sensical adaptations: Includes culturally inappropriate or nonsensical elements (e.g., paratha growing on plants, using rupees as age units)
- 2: Simple replacement of proper nouns: Only names are changed to Indian names without contextual adaptation
- 3: Proper nouns changed along with context: Names and some objects are replaced with culturally relevant alternatives
- 4: Multiple entities changed with deeper connection to Indian culture: Substantial adaptation with culturally relevant scenarios and objects
- 5: Culturally resonating with no further adaptations possible: Complete and authentic cultural adaptation that feels natural to the target audience

2. Language Fluency (0-5):
- 0: No Indian language elements: Uses completely western terminology and expressions
- 1: Very poor language adaptation: Minimal attempt with incorrect use of Indian terms
- 2: Poor language adaptation: Contains few Indian terms but used incorrectly or inappropriately
- 3: Moderate language adaptation: Uses some Indian terms correctly but lacks natural flow
- 4: Good language adaptation: Effectively incorporates Indian English and terminology with natural flow
- 5: Perfect language adaptation: Seamlessly blends Indian terminology, expressions, and natural language patterns

3. Mathematical Integrity (0-5):
- 0: Completely incorrect mathematics: Problem is mathematically nonsensical after adaptation
- 1: Incorrect mathematics: Problems are mathematically unsound or illogical
- 2: Poor mathematical clarity: Basic math is correct but poorly integrated with cultural context
- 3: Moderate mathematical structure: Problems are mathematically sound but could be better contextualized
- 4: Good mathematical adaptation: Well-structured problems with clear cultural context
- 5: Perfect mathematical integration: Mathematics seamlessly integrated with cultural elements while maintaining complete accuracy

Format your response exactly like this (make sure to use actual numeric scores instead of placeholders):

Here are some examples for your reference but you have to properly score them 0-5 based on above mentioned criterias :
