Consider yourself as an AI expert trained to evaluate the cultural adaptation of a given text.

Original Text:
Suzie loves to chew fruit-flavored gum. She bought four packs of gum the last time she was at the store. She got two packs of her favorite flavor, strawberry. She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum that she also liked. She wanted to try something new, so she paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum. If she paid $7 in all, how many dollars did each pack of strawberry gum cost?

Adapted Text:
Ramesh loves to chew mukhwas. He bought four packs of mukhwas the last time he was at the store. He got two packs of his favorite flavor, khusbu. He paid ₹83 for a pack of lassi mukhwas that he also liked. He wanted to try something new, so he paid half as much for a small pack of nimbu mukhwas. If he paid ₹700 in all, how many ₹830 did each pack of khusbu mukhwas cost?

Target Culture: Indian

Rate each criterion on a scale of 0-5 and provide a detailed explanation for your score:

1. Cultural Relevance (0-5):
- 0: No adaptation or complete transliterations/translations: Text maintains western concepts with no attempt at cultural adaptation
- 1: Non-sensical adaptations: Includes culturally inappropriate or nonsensical elements (e.g., paratha growing on plants, using rupees as age units)
- 2: Simple replacement of proper nouns: Only names are changed to Indian names without contextual adaptation
- 3: Proper nouns changed along with context: Names and some objects are replaced with culturally relevant alternatives
- 4: Multiple entities changed with deeper connection to Indian culture: Substantial adaptation with culturally relevant scenarios and objects
- 5: Culturally resonating with no further adaptations possible: Complete and authentic cultural adaptation that feels natural to the target audience

2. Language Fluency (0-5):
- 0: No Indian language elements: Uses completely western terminology and expressions
- 1: Very poor language adaptation: Minimal attempt with incorrect use of Indian terms
- 2: Poor language adaptation: Contains few Indian terms but used incorrectly or inappropriately
- 3: Moderate language adaptation: Uses some Indian terms correctly but lacks natural flow
- 4: Good language adaptation: Effectively incorporates Indian English and terminology with natural flow
- 5: Perfect language adaptation: Seamlessly blends Indian terminology, expressions, and natural language patterns

3. Mathematical Integrity (0-5):
- 0: Completely incorrect mathematics: Problem is mathematically nonsensical after adaptation
- 1: Incorrect mathematics: Problems are mathematically unsound or illogical
- 2: Poor mathematical clarity: Basic math is correct but poorly integrated with cultural context
- 3: Moderate mathematical structure: Problems are mathematically sound but could be better contextualized
- 4: Good mathematical adaptation: Well-structured problems with clear cultural context
- 5: Perfect mathematical integration: Mathematics seamlessly integrated with cultural elements while maintaining complete accuracy

Format your response exactly like this (make sure to use actual numeric scores instead of placeholders):

Here are some examples for your reference but you have to properly score them 0-5 based on above mentioned criterias :

Cultural Relevance: 5
Explanation: The adapted text is deeply integrated with Indian culture, accurately reflecting significant traditions and practices.

Language Fluency: 5
Explanation: The text uses natural Indian expressions and terminology, making it easy to read and culturally coherent.

Mathematical Integrity: 5
Explanation: The mathematical problem is presented correctly and is well-integrated into the cultural context.

Do not output any extra text or placeholders such as "[score]".
