    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture while maintaining the original meaning. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll replace the name Janet with a common Indian female name. Maybe \"Rani\" would be suitable. \n\nNext, the location is mentioned as a farmers' market. In India, we often refer to markets by name, so I'll keep it as \"farmers' market\" but ensure it's culturally appropriate.\n\nThe food items: Janet lays eggs and bakes muffins. In Indian context, eggs are still referred to as eggs, and muffins can be replaced with parathas, which are a common street food. So, muffins become parathas.\n\nCurrency: The problem mentions $2 per egg. Since we're converting to Indian Rupees, I'll use the exchange rate provided. Let's say $1 equals ₹83, so $2 would be ₹166. \n\nNow, putting it all together: Rani's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast and bakes parathas for her friends with four each day. She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for ₹166 per fresh duck egg. How much does she",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture. The original problem is about a robe made from blue and white fibers. First, I'll replace the foreign terms with Indian equivalents. \"Robe\" can be translated to \" kurta\" which is a traditional garment. \n\nNext, I'll adjust the measurements. The problem mentions \"bonds\" of fiber, which I'll convert to \"metres\" as it's a common unit in India. So, 2 bolts become 2 metres of blue fiber. For the white fiber, it's half of that, so 1 metre. \n\nI need to ensure the problem remains clear and culturally appropriate. The question is about the total number of bolts, so I'll phrase it as \"How many metres in total does it take?\" to maintain clarity and flow in the Indian context. \n\nI'll also check that all numerical values are correctly converted and that the problem doesn't introduce any cultural distortions. The adapted text should be coherent and natural for an Indian audience. \n\nFinally, I'll structure the response as a JSON object with the translated text and the replaced concepts. I'll make sure to use the ₹ symbol for currency if needed, but in this case, it's not required. \n\nSo",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture while maintaining the original meaning. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll replace the foreign names. The name \"Josh\" should be changed to a common Indian name. \"Rajesh\" is a good choice as it's a popular male name.\n\nNext, the location \"He buys a house\" should be adjusted to an Indian location. \"He buys a house\" can be rephrased to \"He purchases a house\" to sound more natural in Indian English.\n\nNow, handling the currency. The original text mentions \"$80,000\" and \"$50,000\". Since we're converting to Indian Rupees, I'll replace these with approximate INR values. Using the exchange rate where $1 ≈ ₹83, $80,000 would be approximately ₹6,640,000, and $50,000 would be ₹4,150,000.\n\nThe repairs are mentioned as \"$50,000\", so I'll keep that as \"₹4,150,000\" in the adapted text.\n\nThe increase in house value is given as",
    "Okay, so I need to adapt this text about James running sprints into an Indian cultural context. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the original text is about James running 3 sprints 3 times a week, each sprint being 60 meters. The question is asking how many total meters he runs in a week. \n\nI should replace James with an Indian name. Maybe \"Ramesh\" since it's a common male name. That makes sense because the original is male, and Ramesh is a typical Indian male name.\n\nNext, the term \"sprints\" can be translated to something like \"short dashes\" in Hindi, which is a common term used in sports in India. It's more specific and culturally appropriate.\n\nThe location is mentioned as 60 meters, but in India, tracks are often measured in kilometers. So, converting 60 meters to kilometers would be 0.06 km. That makes it more relatable in an Indian context.\n\nThe question is about total meters a week, so I should phrase it in Hindi. Maybe \"एक सप्ताह में कुल कितने मीटर चला रहा ह�",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture while maintaining the original meaning. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll replace the name \"Wendi\" with a common Indian female name, maybe \"Rani.\" Next, the location \"chickens\" can be translated to \"chickens\" as it's a common term, but I'll ensure it's culturally appropriate.\n\nThe food items \"mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables\" can be simplified to \"mixed diet for the birds, including seeds, insects, and vegetables.\" This makes it more relatable in an Indian context.\n\nNow, the feeding schedule: \"three separate meals\" can be adjusted to \"three feedings a day.\" For the quantities, \"15 cups in the morning\" becomes \"15 cups in the morning,\" \"25 cups in the afternoon\" as \"25 cups in the afternoon,\" and the final meal can be phrased as \"how many cups does she need to feed them in the evening.\"\n\nThe flock size is 20 chickens, which is already a common term, so no changes needed there.\n\nPutting it all together, the adapted text should flow naturally in an Indian setting, using familiar terms and measurements",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture following the specified guidelines. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll replace foreign names. The name \"Kylar\" should be changed to a common Indian female name. Maybe \"Rohini\" would work.\n\nNext, the location \"store\" can be translated to \"bhoot\" which is a common term in Indian English. \n\nThe price is given in USD, so I'll convert $5 to INR. Using the rate of $1 = ₹83, $5 would be ₹415. \n\nThe term \"every second glass\" can be translated to \"every second glass\" in Hindi, but since the user didn't specify, I'll keep it as is but ensure it's culturally appropriate. \n\n\"60% of the price\" can be phrased as \"60% kaafi\" which means 60% of the price. \n\nThe number 16 is fine as it is, but I'll make sure it's used correctly in the context. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Rohini went to bhoot to buy glasses for her new ghar. One glass costs ₹415, but every second glass costs 6",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture. Let's break down the steps.\n\nFirst, the original text is about cities and sheep. I should replace the city names with Indian female names. Toulouse can become Radha, Charleston with Rani, and Seattle with Raniya. \n\nNext, the locations. The original mentions Charleston, which is a place, but in Indian context, I can use a place like Gurgaon. So, Radha is in Gurgaon.\n\nNow, the relationships. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. So, Radha has twice as many as Rani. Rani has four times as many as Seattle, which is Raniya. Since Raniya has 20 sheep, Rani has 4*20=80. Then Radha has 2*80=160.\n\nFinally, the total sheep together: 160 (Radha) + 80 (Rani) + 20 (Raniya) = 260 sheep.\n\nI need to make sure the replaced_concepts only include the terms that changed. So, Radha, Rani, Raniya, and Gurgaon are the ones that",
    "Okay, so I need to adapt the given text into Indian culture. Let me read through the original text first. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. She can download at 2 GB per minute normally. But 40% in, which is 80 GB, Windows forces a restart for updates taking 20 minutes. Then she has to restart the download. The question is about the load to download the file.\n\nFirst, I should replace any foreign names with Indian names. Carla can be changed to Rani, a common Indian name. Next, the location can be converted to a nearby Indian city, maybe Mumbai. So the file size is 200 GB, which is standard, so no change there.\n\nThe download speed is 2 GB per minute. In Indian context, maybe it's better to use terms like \"data rate\" or \"speed.\" So I can say Rani is downloading a 200 GB file at a speed of 2 GB per minute.\n\nWhen 40% of the download is done, that's 80 GB. Windows forcing a restart for updates taking 20 minutes. So I can phrase this as a system update taking 20 minutes during the download.\n\nThen she",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture while maintaining the original meaning. Let me go through the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll replace John with a common Indian male name. Let's choose \"Ramesh\" as it's a popular name.\n\nNext, I'll replace the locations. Since the original doesn't specify, I'll keep it general but use Indian terms. Maybe \"city\" is fine.\n\nFor currencies, the original mentions mph, which is miles per hour. I'll convert that to kilometers per hour for consistency with Indian measurements. So, 60 mph becomes approximately 96.56 km/h. But to keep it simple, I'll round it to 97 km/h.\n\nThe time durations are in hours, which are the same in both cultures, so no change needed there.\n\nThe speeds are in mph, so converting them to km/h makes sense. 30 mph is about 48.28 km/h, which I'll round to 48 km/h. 80 mph is approximately 128.75 km/h, rounding to 129 km/h.\n\nNow, I'll rephrase the scenario using Indian terms. Ramesh drives for 3 hours at",
    "Alright, I need to adapt the given text to Indian culture. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original text mentions Eliza's hourly rate as $10. I should convert this to Indian Rupees. Since 1 USD is approximately ₹83, $10 would be ₹830. So, I'll replace $10 with ₹830.\n\nNext, Eliza works 40 hours at her regular rate and 5 hours overtime. In Indian contexts, it's common to refer to professionals like teachers or workers as \"sir\" or \"ma'am.\" So, I'll change Eliza to \"Rani\" (a common Indian female name) and use \"sir\" appropriately.\n\nThe overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular rate. In India, this is often referred to as \"time and a half.\" So, I'll keep that term as it's widely understood.\n\nShe worked 45 hours, which is 40 regular and 5 overtime. I'll phrase this as \"40 hours of regular work and 5 hours of overtime work.\"\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the sentence to reflect these changes while keeping the original meaning intact. I'll ensure that"
